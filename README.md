Glad to see you here!  

As a **DevOps Engineer**, I obsess over streamlining workflows, eliminating toil, and bridging the gap between development and operations. I thrive on building systems that scale seamlessly, deploy reliably, and secure proactively.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
🐳 Docker | ⚓ Kubernetes | ⚙️ Jenkins | ☁️ AWS | � Terraform | 📊 Prometheus/Grafana | 🐍 Python | 🌿 Git | 🛡️ Trivy/OWASP

## ❓ Why DevOps?  
Because *"it works on my machine"* isn’t good enough. I design systems that just work—**anywhere, anytime.**

## ✨ Playbook Highlights  
- **"Abracadabra, Deploy Faster!"**: Slashed deployment time by **20%** with Jenkins pipelines and Dockerized magic.  
- **"Kubernetes Jedi Moves"**: Tamed wild clusters, slashed downtime, and taught pods to self-heal.  
- **"Terraform Sorcery"**: Conjured AWS EC2, EKS, and VPCs out of thin IaC (Infrastructure as Code).  
- **"Security Shield Charm"**: Embedded Trivy + SonarQube into pipelines—because vulnerabilities fear proactive wizards.  
- **"Git Harmony"**: Orchestrated team symphonies with Git, boosting collaboration by **30%**. No merge conflicts, just pure rhythm.
